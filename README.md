# CodeAlpha_EmotionRecognitionFromSpeech
# CodeAlpha - Emotion Recognition from Speech

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship. The objective is to build a model that can classify speech into different categories using audio signal processing and deep learning.

## âœ… Features
- Audio feature extraction using **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
- Implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification
- Used **Free Spoken Digit Dataset** as a lightweight audio dataset for demonstration
- Performance evaluation with:
  - Accuracy metrics
  - Confusion matrix visualization
- Visualization of model training (accuracy and loss curves)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Librosa (audio feature extraction)
- TensorFlow / Keras (deep learning)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (metrics)
